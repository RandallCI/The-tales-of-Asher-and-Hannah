Being brought up by parents who believed in the principle of reading, not just for education but also for enjoyment. I have spent much time in libraries. I was when I was very young especially fond of the colorful childrens books which brought to me so much joy any time I got the opertunity to spend with my books. Today though, many children do not appreciate a library as much as they should or have become so accustomed to using a computer, a phone or a tablet to get their resources it has become needful to use the current state of the art to create this type of content for children. What I am doing here is not perhaps the best way to do things but I am hoping that it will be a turning point where we bring children back to reading for enjoyment and to spur the imagination in a healthy way.
