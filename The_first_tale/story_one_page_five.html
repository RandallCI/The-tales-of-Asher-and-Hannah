            One day, it was such a lovely day,
            that Ash and Hannah were playing outside.
            Ash was playing on the see-saw in their garden
            and Hannah wanted to see how high she could jump.
            The problem was, the see-saw was not much fun when you were only
            one person and jumping on her own turned out to be not much fun
            when doing it alone today.
